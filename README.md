**Robot Apa**
Introduction
the purpose of this app is to enable survivors to add them selves on the system Robot Apa, they can change their location and infection stasus

Prerequisites
List of prerequisites required to run the project, includes:

Python (3.1)
PostgreSQL (16)

Installation
Step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project:

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone <repository_url>
To run this code and test the API endpoints with Postman, follow these instructions:

Prerequisites:
Python installed on your system.
PostgreSQL database server installed and running.
Postman installed on your system.
Steps:
Clone Repository:
Clone the repository containing the code onto your local machine.

Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install flask psycopg2
Database Setup:

Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running.
Create a database named "robotApocalypse" in your PostgreSQL server.
Database Configuration:

Open the app.py file in a text editor.
Update the database connection details (dbname, user, password, host, port) in the psycopg2.connect() calls within the add_survivor_endpoint(), update_location_endpoint(), and flag_infected_endpoint() functions to match your PostgreSQL configuration.
Run the Flask Application:

In the terminal, navigate to the project directory.
Run the Flask application by executing the following command:
Copy code
python app.py
Testing Endpoints with Postman:

Launch Postman on your system.
Use the following endpoints to test the API:
Add Survivor: Send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/add_survivors with JSON data containing survivor details to add a survivor.
Update Survivor Location: Send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/update_location/<survivor_id> with JSON data containing new latitude and longitude to update a survivor's location.
Flag Survivor as Infected: Send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/flag_infected/<survivor_id> to flag a survivor as infected.
Verify Database Changes:

After making requests to the API endpoints, verify the changes in the "robotApocalypse" database tables (e.g., "survivors") using a PostgreSQL client or command-line tools.
Additional Notes:

Ensure that the data sent in the POST requests to the API endpoints is valid and matches the expected format.
Check the terminal where the Flask application is running for any error messages or debug output.
Additional Tips:
Ensure that the Flask application is running (app.run(debug=True) in app.py) while testing the API endpoints with Postman.
Pay attention to the status codes and response messages returned by the API endpoints in Postman to identify any errors or issues.
Refer to the logs generated by the Flask application (if any) for debugging purposes.
By following these steps, you should be able to run the code and test the API endpoints using Postman effectively.
Install project dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the PostgreSQL database:

Create a new database named robotApocalypse.
Update the database configuration in database.py with your PostgreSQL credentials.
Run the Flask application:

css
Copy code
python main.py
Access the application in your web browser:

Copy code
http://localhost:5000/
